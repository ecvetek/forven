"""A gauntlet -> paper promotion gate that fails on an ORDERING / stale-validation
verdict must RETRY (blocked_runtime), never drain to a terminal ``failed_gate``.

Root cause it guards (S03523): optimization re-ran, producing fresh params, but the
paper-promotion gate was evaluated in the ~20-min window before walk_forward re-ran on
those params. The gate's artifact-ordering check ("walk_forward was run before
optimization — re-run after optimization") tripped, the gate-check step returned
``failed_gate``, the workflow drained to ``status='failed_gate'`` after burning its
retries, and demote_failed_gate_strategies ARCHIVED a genuinely-passing strategy.

The ordering violation is PENDING RE-VALIDATION, not a merit failure — it self-resolves
the instant walk_forward re-runs. So the gate must return a retryable block whose
reason_code is in engine._NO_DRAIN_REASON_CODES (never burns down to failed_gate); the
2-day un-promotable hygiene backstop catches any genuine deadlock. Generic: ANY strategy
whose validation re-runs slightly after its optimization was being mis-archived.
